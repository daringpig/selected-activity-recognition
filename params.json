In this page, I decided to put some information about previous project that I had worked on.\r\nThis is not perfect project so I ask everyone to check for the inconsitencies. \r\n\r\nThis project is about Linear acceleration data from triaxial sensor used for classifying selected human activities. Selected activities, such as running, jogging, walking and idle are classified. The application made for Android, uses K3DH 3-axis acceleration sensor data for classifying the mentioned activities using Machine learning & Datamining algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Setup instructions\r\n* Clone the repository. If you are using eclipse, make sure that the project is imported from Git reopository.\r\n* Go through WEKA ecosystem.\r\n* This repository is used for classifying feature vectors _on-the fly_ .\r\n* Configure build path appropriately.\r\n",
